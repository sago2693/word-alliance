<h1> DNLP SS23 Final Project - Multitask BERT</h1>
</div>

In this repository you will find code for the final project of the the _M.Inf.2202 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing_ course at the University of G√∂ttingen. You can find the handout [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkgwFZyClZ_qk718ObYhi8tF4cjSSQ?e=3gECnf).

In this project, important components of the BERT model are implemented. 
Embeddings produced by our BERT model were used for three downstream tasks: sentiment classification, paraphrase detection and semantic similarity.

We implemented [ADD EXTENSION HERE] to improve the baseline model.

## Requirements
* Make sure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
* Run [setup.sh](./setup.sh) to set up a conda environment and install dependencies:
```
source setup.sh
```
The setup.sh file contains the following:
```setup
#!/usr/bin/env bash

conda create -n dnlp python=3.8
conda activate dnlp

conda install pytorch==1.8.0 torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
pip install tqdm==4.58.0
pip install requests==2.25.1
pip install importlib-metadata==3.7.0
pip install filelock==3.0.12
pip install sklearn==0.0
pip install tokenizers==0.10.1
pip install explainaboard_client==0.0.7
```
Activate the dnlp environment by running:
```
conda activate dnlp
```
Details of the environment so that used libraries and dependencies can be found in environment.yml file

## Training
Since the model is designed to perform three different NLP tasks, we train on three different datasets. More precisely, we use the [Standford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html) (Socher et al., 2013), consisting of 11,855 single sentences from movie reviews extracted from movie reviews, to classify a text's sentiment. Further, we use the Quora dataset consisting of 400,000 question pairs to train for paraphrase detection. Lastly, we seek to measure the degree of semantic equivalence, using data from the SemEval STS Benchmark dataset consisting of 8,628 sentence pairs of varying similarity. 

To train the model, run this command:

```
python -u multitask_classifier.py --option finetune --lr 1e-5 --batch_size 64 --local_files_only
```
or just run the provided [submit_train.sh](./submit_train.sh) file containing the command above using _sbash_.

```train
sbash submit_train.sh
```
>Note: The hyperparameters for our best model are already included in the above code snippets.   

#### Disclaimer: We trained on a computer cluster provided by university IT infrastructure. You may run into issues with slow training speed when using commonly used hardware systems.

## Evaluation

The evaluation of the model is conducted after each epoch and done so automatically when training. The method _model_eval_multitask()_ imported from [evaluation.py](/evaluation.py) evaluates each epoch.

We evaluate each task separately and create a weighted metric summary for all

* Paraphrase Detection: Proportion of correctly classified paraphrase pairs 
* Sentiment Classification: Proportion of correct classification of sentiment
* Semantic Textual Similarity: Pearson correlation coefficient of predicted and true values
* Best Metric: Weighted average of each tasks

## Pre-trained Models

For this project we used the so called [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) pre-trained model implementation that loads pre-trained weights. Within the [multitask_classifier.py](./multitask_classifier.py) file we call the _from_pretrained()_ method from [base_bert.py](./base_bert.py) to retrieve the pre-trained model. In other words, when trying to run the training, you mind want to replace "finetune" to "pretrain", i.e.
```
python -u multitask_classifier.py --option pretrain --lr 1e-5 --batch_size 64 --local_files_only
``` 

## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR STS
According to : https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/sts/README.html

To train our network, we need to normalize these scores to a range of 0-1. This can simply be done by dividing the score by 5.
They also suggest a cosine similarity loss.
This article suggests solving STS in a different way:
https://thepythoncode.com/article/finetune-bert-for-semantic-textual-similarity-in-python#models-architecture.
In fact, in the project's documentation the output of this task SEEMS TO BE in the range from 0 to 1
## Multi-task learning setup
Mult-task learning is a hot research topic in which several features of the model and the training process are studied. Here he discuss briefly the following ones: ********************************Architecture, Loss Function and mini-batch configuration********************************

**************************Architecture:**************************

Multiple MTL models for NLP bear a structural similarity to the initial shared architectures found in computer vision. These consist of a communal, a shared global feature extractor succeeded by specialized output branches for various tasks. Unlike Computer Vision, the features correspond to to word representations"   Simply put, it involves a shared word representation, or embeddings, along with a feedforward neural network (FFN) for each task. (Crawshaw, 2020, p. 6) We are following this approach for the architecture to focus more on changes in the training procedure.

**************************Loss function**************************

‚ÄúThe most common approach to train an MTL model is to linearly combine loss functions of different tasks into a single global loss function‚Äù (Chen et al., 2021, p. 9) The problem becomes how to choose the weights. The simplest way consists of asigning the same weight for all of them:

$$
L = \sum_{t=1}^{M} \lambda_{t} L_{t} 

$$

Given M tasks with their corresponding weights Lambda and Losses L, the simplest way to go about choosing the weights is to set them equal to each other, ùúÜùë° = 1/ùëÄ. To prevent the largest dataset from dominating the others, the weight is set to be inversely proportional to the dataset size.

‚Äúsince dynamically assigning smaller weights to more uncertain tasks usually leads to good performance for MTL according to [17], [57] assigns weights based on the homoscedasticity of training losses from different tasks‚Äù (Chen et al., 2021, p. 9)

$$
\lambda_{t} = \frac{1}{2\sigma_{t}^{2}}

$$

According to (Lauscher et al., 2018) the Loss function with that weighting equals:
$$
\text{Total loss} = \sum_{t} \frac{1}{2\sigma_{t}^{2}} L_{t} + \ln(\sigma_{t}^{2})

$$

Given the project's goal of havingthe best overall performance in the 3 tasks, we will use the dynamic weight assignment to ensure that the gradients are driven by the less noisy task to possibly have a slower but more stable learning.

**************Mini-batches configuration:**************

The typical approach in curriculum learning for transfer learning tasks involves constructing mini-batches that comprise examples specific to an individual task. Subsequently, during training, there is an alternating progression between these tasks. (Worsham and Kalita, 2020, p. 6) 

‚Äú‚Äú(Stickland and Murray, 2019) propose a technique called annealed sampling in which batch sampling is originally based on the ratio of dataset sizes and slowly anneals to an even distribution across all tasks as the current epoch number increases. These discoveries, when combined with curriculum research emerging from the field of reinforcement learning‚Äù (Worsham and Kalita, 2020, p. 6) (pdf). The formula of the annealed sampling introduces a factor alpha to which the dataset size must be raised:
$$
\P_i \propto N_i^\alpha
$$
$$
\text{Where}
$$
$$
\alpha = 1 - 0.8 \left( \frac{e - 1}{E - 1} \right)
$$
 Giventhe considerable difference of sizes between the paraphrase identification dataset and the other two (140.000 vs around 7000), We will use this technique to aim for a balanced distibution of samples at the end of the training.
